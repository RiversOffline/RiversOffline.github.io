    <button class="accordion">GPS searching returns no/few rivers?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            As of now, rivers.run has very few GPS coordinates for rivers, so very few will show up in searches. If you would like to show rivers without GPS coordinates,
            a checkbox is provided. <br><br>

    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            If are encountering issues, your browser may be too old. Here are the browsers that should work:<br>
            <br>
            Chrom(e/ium), Opera, Microsoft Edge (Blink) - Full Support for Latest Version. Versions down to Blink/V8 4.0ish should work.<br>
            Any Browser on iOS 9.3+ (iOS 11.3+ needed for offline support)<br>
            Firefox - Full Support can be obtained down to Firefox 60 ESR. river-overview popups break below version 60<br>
            Opera Mini - Fails in extreme data saving mode. Somewhat glitchy, though usable, in other modes.<br>
            Samsung Internet - Based on WebKit just like Safari, so it should work<br>
            Microsoft Edge (Chakra) - Full Support believed for latest version<br>
            <br>
            Internet Explorer does <strong>NOT</strong> work
            <br><br>
            If you encounter issues while using a supported browser, please refer to "where can I contact you" below.
        </p>

    <button class="accordion">Where can I contact you?</button>

    <button class="accordion">How does rivers.run work offline?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>rivers.run utilizes your browsers cache to store the contents of this site - So whenever rivers.run is in cache, you can visit it.
            <em> If for any reason your cache is cleared, then you will be unable to visit rivers.run without internet until the cache is refilled on the next visit.</em>
            <br>
            Don't worry about old content though - If rivers.run is using data more than 1 hour old, it will show very obvious warnings, and the site will update the cached
            data the next time it is loaded while online.<br><br>

            Note: A newer browser is required for offline support.

    <button class="accordion">How do I link to a normal search?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The URL to a normal search is https://rivers.run#YOUR_SEARCH_QUERY<br>If you want to test the URL, make sure you put it in a new tab.</p>
