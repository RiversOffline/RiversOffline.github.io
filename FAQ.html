    <button class="accordion">How do I use the search box?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Just type in what you are looking for. The website will update results as you type.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How can I sort the rivers?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Click the headers to sort. Currently, you may only sort by name, skill, rating, and flow.

    <button class="accordion">What do stripes on a river mean?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
			Stripes on a river mean that the river has dam releases. A link to the release schedule should be included along with the stripes,
			although you will want to check to make sure that the release schedule is for the correct year.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How does the shading and sort by flow work?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Relative flows (Too low, low, too high, etc) are calculated using a logarithmic scale based off of a given minimum, maximum, and other optional values.<br>
            The values being used to calculate relative flows are shown above the graph. Computer generated values will be labeled with (computer).<br>
            If you would like to contribute flow range information (such as a minimum, a maximum, a mid flow, etc), refer to "How do I improve an existing river?" above.<br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Where does flow information come from?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Flow information is obtained from <a href="https://usgs.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USGS</a> (United States Geolocial Survey)<br>
			rivers.run is working on adding support for NWS (National Weather Service) gauges, as well as gauge for other countries.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What are virtual gauges?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Virtual gauges are gauges that are calculated based on other gauges. Virtual gauges are identified by the prefix "virtual:" in the name, which is located on the graph.
            If you would like to add a virtual gauge, please contact <a href="mailto:admin@rivers.run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admin@rivers.run</a>.
        </p>

    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            This is migrating to the clubs page.

            edtop
            edclassic
            yougharea

    <button class="accordion">I would like to help build the website</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            You can access the repository on <a href="https://github.com/ecc521/rivers.run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.

    <button class="accordion">Skill/Class used to show up and now doesn't!</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Both skill and class only show up on larger screens (if you are on a phone, you can try rotating into landscape mode). If you would like to select
            which of the two shows up when there is not enough space to show both, you may do that in the <a href="settings.html">settings</a>.

    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            If are encountering issues, your browser may be too old. Here are the browsers that should work:
            <br><br>
            Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, Samsung Internet - Full support for non-horribly outdated versions.
			<br><br>
            Any Browser on iOS 8.4+ (maybe lower). iOS 11.3+ needed for offline support. Web push notifications not supported. Dark mode needs iOS 10. Below iOS 9, empty space appears between rivers on home page.
			<br><br>
            Internet Explorer 11 - Should be totally usable. Skill explainations do not work, dark mode changes require a reload, and push notifications are not supported.
			<br><br>
			Opera Mini - Fails in extreme data saving mode. On the home page, the navigaton menu may lack styling, and the advanced search menu may be at the bottom of the page.<br>
            <br><br>
            If you encounter issues while using a supported browser, please refer to "where can I contact you" below.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Where can I contact you?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfH9IEWMWGE13m5BEEuTqcFKd85qtVRGnPX5GB2kVyM3IFKnA/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedback Form</a>, or you can email me at <a href="mailto:contact@rivers.run" target="_blank">contact@rivers.run</a></p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How does rivers.run work offline?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>rivers.run utilizes your browsers cache to store the contents of this site - So whenever rivers.run is in cache, you can visit it.
            <em> If for any reason your cache is cleared, then you will be unable to visit rivers.run without internet until the cache is refilled on the next visit.</em>
            <br>
            Don't worry about old content though - If rivers.run is using data more than 1 hour old, it will show very obvious warnings, and the site will update the cached
            data the next time it is loaded while online.<br><br>

            Note: Not all supported browsers have offline capabilities.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How do I link to a specific search?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Do your search - the search url will be in both the url bar (javascript tricks!) and at the bottom of the advanced search menu.</p>
