One can catch them up in a wet period but the Savage lake is small and is a source of drinking water so releases are few and, except for race related events, are announced on short notice.  <br>The put in for the Savage is up Savage River Road (off Md. 135, just west of the river) after crossing the river twice.  The put in for the N. Br. is to go downstream from the confluence of the two rivers and cross the river and follow WV 46 uphill - making only right turns.  Finally at three churches take the right turn down to Barnum [fee].  Check out Pap's store for sodas, snacks & stories.<br>The take out for the Savage is at the confluence with the N. Br. where there is very limited parking.  Do not aggravate the locals by breaking any parking laws or trespassing.  In addition to the limited parking here the N. Br. has additional parking upstream by going west on 135 past Savage Rd. and taking the first left (Hamill Ave.)  and then another left downhill to a county park & small sewage plant.<br><br><br>Camping:  The nicest camping is upstream of the N.

Walk past the gate and down to the river to identify the takeout (upstream) from the river.  3)The last takeout suggested is at the convenient boat ramp in Brunswick (under the rt. 17 bridge).  This involves 3 miles of flat water paddling and a bit of scouting to get to by car - take 340 north to first Brunswick/Knoxville exit and take first right (rt. 478), still following the railroad.  Go under overhead bridge and take a right onto the only road going across the tracks and then turn right to boat ramp. Do not block ramp, turning area or parking areas from use by large trailered vehicles.  For both rivers there is limited put-in access also.  Although there has been some vandalism at the suggested take-outs, most problems occur at the put-ins.  The Shenandoah has two recommended put-ins.  The \"guidebook\" put in is at the power company picnic area well above Millville (take US 340 west into WV and turn left at the flea market (Millville rd.); go through \"town\" and follow the river upstream to just before the road veers to the right away from the river.  This involves talking to the local picnicers about whether it is OK to park there.  They will usually watch your car only as long as they are there.  If there aren't many people here, as is the case along the river downstream or in cold weather, your car may be picked clean while you are gone.  In season (Aprilish to Octoberish), there is an outfitter park nearer Millville where an individual will watch cars for $5. per car.  This is well worth it.  Parking nearby may not get your car back in one piece.  Do NOT stop at Harper's Ferry (river left) on your trip or you may be arrested by park police!  <br>Tips: Take-outs fill up early on a hot summer day so arrive early.  Both runs are somewhat short but can involve a full days activity if you play a lot or lengthen the trip.

If you park in the no parking zone (virtually the entire area) you will be ticketed & towed.  What “may” work is to park in the large lot just past the gas station and walk to your car.  This is subject to negotiation when the lot is in use for fireworks, food, etc.  2)The second takeout is at Weverton in Maryland.  This is found by driving to the yellow light just in Maryland, turning downstream (pass Cindy-D restaurant) and driving to the end where there is shoulder parking.  Do not block the gate where you will be towed.  Walk past the gate and down to the river to identify the takeout (upstream) from the river.  3)The last takeout suggested is at the convenient boat ramp in Brunswick (under the rt. 17 bridge).  This involves 3 miles of flat water paddling and a bit of scouting to get to by car - take 340 north to first Brunswick/Knoxville exit and take first right (rt. 478), still following the railroad.  Go under overhead bridge and take a right onto the only road going across the tracks and then turn right to boat ramp. Do not block ramp, turning area or parking areas from use by large trailered vehicles.  For both rivers there is limited put-in access also.  Although there has been some vandalism at the suggested take-outs, most problems occur at the put-ins.  If you are paddling the Potomac you most likely will want to put-in at the Shinham boat ramp; drive US 340 into Maryland and take the first right (at the flashing light) and then the first right again (pass youth hostel and Sandy Hook) and continue on same road away from river until about the third left - (road going downhill) to ramp.  Again, do not block others with large trailers from using the ramp or parking areas.  The recommended second put-in is on the WV side of the river which has a private outfitter that will allow access in season for a price [per trip or per season].<br>Tips: Take-outs fill up early on a hot summer day so arrive early.  Both runs are somewhat short but can involve a full days activity if you play a lot or lengthen the trip.  River & Trails Outfitters (flashing light, 340 just in Maryland) has all your basic river supplies/shuttle and the Sheetz gas station in Brunswick (US 340 to rt. 17) has best gas prices and yummy subs.<br><br><br>Monacacy: Low Intermediate 2-2+; Hancock 3.0"},{"USGS":"01631000","Tags":"va, shenandoah","Name":"Shenandoah - South Fork","Section":"Rt 50 to Rt 7","Difficulty":"B","Quality":"3","Length":"","Writeup":"SHENANDOAH RIVER in Virginia<br>        (703) 996-2200 X3 [Front Royal, Cootes Store gauges]<br><br><br>The Shenandoah River has headwater streams that challenge the best of creek boaters on the few days that they hold water.
