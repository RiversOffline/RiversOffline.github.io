Also, the Musconetcong (Cl 1-2) is just across the river too.<br>Directions:  Take I-95 north through Baltimore, Wilmington and Philadelphia until the last exit in Pa.  [Rt. 332 to Newtown is the exit before the one you want.] Take rt.32 north to New Hope and Point Pleasant.(Approx. 10 mi. from I-95 to New Hope and 10 mi. further to Point Pleasant.) Pt.Pleasant is a small town.<br><br>To Put-In:  On south side of Tohickon Creek & rt. 32 take road going upstream along creek.  Turn right at 3 way intersection at top of hill and go to Ralph Stover State Park.<br><br>To Take-Out:  The popular & big take out is at the mouth of the creek.  On the north side of the creek at rt. 32 take the first right, go over canal on wooden one lane bridge, and pay/park at Bucks County River Country (215) 297-8823.  Try not to get towed in town.  If you want free parking scout downstream along the Delaware River or Bull Island (N.J.)(very limited parking available).<br><br>To Camping:  On the north side of the creek at rt. 32 take a left at the canoe rental sign and another quick left in front of the white church (Cafferty rd.)  Go 1 to 1 1/2 mi. to park at top of hill.  The first entrance on left is for day use only, the second entrance is the campground.  Tohickon Valley Park (215) 757-0571 has nice wooded but rocky sites and one bath house.  Hiking trails go down to the river.  Other camping areas nearby are not as convenient on release dates but Ralph Stover State Park (215) 982-5560 has a few hard to get cabins and Bull Island Park (609) 397-2949 (in New Jersey north of Stockton) has a nice campground that is open only during warmer times. <br><br>Dining:  Generally very tough to find.  Breakfast can be found in the Village Store in Pt. Pleasant and scouts often set up a basic breakfast/lunch place at the put-in.  Doylestown & Quakertown are the nearest towns with nice choices of restaurants.  Avoid New Hope due to crowds (Nov. especially) and generally high cost.  Off season, the Villa Vito on West Bridge St. in New Hope (215) 862-9936 has very good Italian at reasonable prices but check the NJ side for less crowded options, including the nice Italian restaurant (Nicoli) at east end of Bridge St. <br><br>Nearby gauges/runs: (N.

Potomac\"Needles\"through Harper's Ferry cuts through the nearby mountains.  The Harper's Ferry area is home to the Potomac \"Needles\" (novice skills with full floatation suggested, Class I to III) as well as many miles of flat floating waters both upstream on the Shenadoah and Potomac and downstream on the Potomac.  This section of river is very reliable with the Potomac section up except in severe drought (Shepardstown = 1.4 or Point of Rocks at .5).  Consider any of these gauges above 4' with caution and over 5' as requiring big river water skills.  <br>Ins and Outs: The Staircase section and the Needles section are used by countless thousands of paddlers each season and a certain history should be known about the area.  There are significant vandalism, property owner and access problems that need to be considered.  The three take-outs for either river is at 1)Potoma wayside in Virginia - on US340, just over the bridge from Maryland.  There is parking for 3-4 cars - PERIOD!!  If you park in the no parking zone (virtually the entire area) you will be ticketed & towed.  What “may” work is to park in the large lot just past the gas station and walk to your car.  This is subject to negotiation when the lot is in use for fireworks, food, etc.  2)The second takeout is at Weverton in Maryland.  This is found by driving to the yellow light just in Maryland, turning downstream (pass Cindy-D restaurant) and driving to the end where there is shoulder parking.  Do not block the gate where you will be towed.  Walk past the gate and down to the river to identify the takeout (upstream) from the river.  3)The last takeout suggested is at the convenient boat ramp in Brunswick (under the rt. 17 bridge).  This involves 3 miles of flat water paddling and a bit of scouting to get to by car - take 340 north to first Brunswick/Knoxville exit and take first right (rt. 478), still following the railroad.  Go under overhead bridge and take a right onto the only road going across the tracks and then turn right to boat ramp. Do not block ramp, turning area or parking areas from use by large trailered vehicles.  For both rivers there is limited put-in access also.  Although there has been some vandalism at the suggested take-outs, most problems occur at the put-ins.  If you are paddling the Potomac you most likely will want to put-in at the Shinham boat ramp; drive US 340 into Maryland and take the first right (at the flashing light) and then the first right again (pass youth hostel and Sandy Hook) and continue on same road away from river until about the third left - (road going downhill) to ramp.  Again, do not block others with large trailers from using the ramp or parking areas.  The recommended second put-in is on the WV side of the river which has a private outfitter that will allow access in season for a price [per trip or per season].<br>Tips: Take-outs fill up early on a hot summer day so arrive early.  Both runs are somewhat short but can involve a full days activity if you play a lot or lengthen the trip.

The \"guidebook\" put in is at the power company picnic area well above Millville (take US 340 west into WV and turn left at the flea market (Millville rd.); go through \"town\" and follow the river upstream to just before the road veers to the right away from the river.  This involves talking to the local picnicers about whether it is OK to park there.  They will usually watch your car only as long as they are there.  If there aren't many people here, as is the case along the river downstream or in cold weather, your car may be picked clean while you are gone.  In season (Aprilish to Octoberish), there is an outfitter park nearer Millville where an individual will watch cars for $5. per car.  This is well worth it.
