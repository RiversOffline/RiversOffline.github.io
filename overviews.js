Potomac basin to the west, the basin in between offers up all levels of paddling enjoyment. The upper Lost Riveris very flat & takes a lot of water to get up (Cootes Store = 3.2). The farmland scenery is nice & the fishing is good. There are many access points along rts. 55 and 259. Then the Lost either gets \"lost\" by going underground as it crosses under rt. 55 or overflows a gorge (Lost River Gorge) with fine intermediate level water & remote scenery when Cootes Store is 3.5, Moorefield=2.7 and Franklin=2.5. It emerges at Wardensville as the Cacapon Riverand except for some playful whitewater at Wardensville calms down to easy water until a section below US 50 and above rt. 127 which has 3 Cl II ledges and great scenery. It then calms down again until the Potomac. Look for Great Cacapon to be at least 2.0 for the flat sections and 4.0 for the Lost River Gorge and the piece just below. The boat landing areas at rt. 127 & at Great Cacapon have seen some vandalism since the vandals know that the occupants will be gone for many hours or overnight.<br>Major tributaries include the fast but not too difficult Howards Lick Runfrom Lost River State Park (camping available); Baker Runfrom Needmore to Baker which is similar but wider & steeper in parts; Trout Run, a popular Cl III+ run when the gorge is high; Waites Run, a steep but not outrageous run that has many strainers to keep you jumping, Moores Run, a steep but short tributary below Wardensville and the North River and its tributaries. All should be scouted as much as possible for strainers. Look for Springfield to be 3.3 for the flat lower section of the North Riverand Moorefield to be around 4.6 for an intermediate level run on theNorth River Gorgeabove Rio. Use caution if the river is high as the gorge builds up big hydraulics. If the gorge is running you may also have an opportunity to run the slightly easier, ledgier & very prettyTearcoat Creekfrom above US 50 to the North River.<br>Nearby streams to also consider are the easy & pretty Little Cacaponto the west and the pretty & easy Sleepy Creek& advanced/expert terror called Meadow Branchto the east.

These sections of river are very reliable with the Potomac section up except in severe drought (Shepardstown = 1.4 or Point of Rocks at .5) and the Shenandoah section paddleable down to Millville = 1.3 and enjoyable down to 2.0'. Consider any of these gauges above 4' with caution and over 5' as requiring big river water skills. <br>Ins and Outs: The Staircase section and the Needles section are used by countless thousands of paddlers each season and a certain history should be known about the area. There are significant vandalism, property owner and access problems that need to be considered. The three take-outs for either river is at 1)Potoma wayside in Virginia - on US340, just over the bridge from Maryland. There is parking for 3-4 cars - PERIOD!! If you park in the no parking zone (virtually the entire area) you will be ticketed & towed. What “may” work is to park in the large lot just past the gas station and walk to your car. This is subject to negotiation when the lot is in use for fireworks, food, etc. 2)The second takeout is at Weverton in Maryland. This is found by driving to the yellow light just in Maryland, turning downstream (pass Cindy-D restaurant) and driving to the end where there is shoulder parking. Do not block the gate where you will be towed. Walk past the gate and down to the river to identify the takeout (upstream) from the river. 3)The last takeout suggested is at the convenient boat ramp in Brunswick (under the rt. 17 bridge). This involves 3 miles of flat water paddling and a bit of scouting to get to by car - take 340 north to first Brunswick/Knoxville exit and take first right (rt. 478), still following the railroad. Go under overhead bridge and take a right onto the only road going across the tracks and then turn right to boat ramp. Do not block ramp, turning area or parking areas from use by large trailered vehicles. For both rivers there is limited put-in access also. Although there has been some vandalism at the suggested take-outs, most problems occur at the put-ins. The Shenandoah has two recommended put-ins. The \"guidebook\" put in is at the power company picnic area well above Millville (take US 340 west into WV and turn left at the flea market (Millville rd.); go through \"town\" and follow the river upstream to just before the road veers to the right away from the river. This involves talking to the local picnicers about whether it is OK to park there. They will usually watch your car only as long as they are there. If there aren't many people here, as is the case along the river downstream or in cold weather, your car may be picked clean while you are gone. In season (Aprilish to Octoberish), there is an outfitter park nearer Millville where an individual will watch cars for $5. per car. This is well worth it. Parking nearby may not get your car back in one piece. Do NOT stop at Harper's Ferry (river left) on your trip or you may be arrested by park police! If you are paddling the Potomac you most likely will want to put-in at the Shinham boat ramp; drive US 340 into Maryland and take the first right (at the flashing light) and then the first right again (pass youth hostel and Sandy Hook) and continue on same road away from river until about the third left - (road going downhill) to ramp. Again, do not block others with large trailers from using the ramp or parking areas. The recommended second put-in is on the WV side of the river which has a private outfitter that will allow access in season for a price [per trip or per season].<br>Tips: Take-outs fill up early on a hot summer day so arrive early. Both runs are somewhat short but can involve a full days activity if you play a lot or lengthen the trip. River & Trails Outfitters (flashing light, 340 just in Maryland) has all your basic river supplies/shuttle and the Sheetz gas station in Brunswick (US 340 to rt. 17) has best gas prices and yummy subs.","Lower Savage & North Branch Area":"Lower Savage & N. Br. Potomac below Jennings Randolph Lake<br>These two very popular runs are very similar to the Gauley, Lehigh, Tohickon, North Anna and Gunpowder - they usually depend on someone turning a valve at a dam for there to be paddleable water.  One can catch them up in a wet period but the Savage lake is small and is a source of drinking water so releases are few and, except for race related events, are announced on short notice.  Consider the 5 mile run as advanced at 1000CFS although the lower section (below a church) is fairly straightforward but fast.  The 5 mile \"Bloomington\" release schedule has become more formalized and can be expected on 4 weekends in the spring - two releases in April, two in May.  Occasional summer and scheduled fall releases are usually announced a week or two in advance.  Clubs in the Pittsburg/Baltimore/ Washington area get notice of releases about as soon as they are announced by the Corps of Engineers. The section below the dam is intermediate at 1000 CFS and usually requires a small parking fee.  The section from Bloomington to Keyser is a playful Class 2 and from Keyser to above Cumberland is a pretty Class 1 - and is often up without a release - Pinto gauge should be at least 3'.  For high flows (Barton@500CFS+) try Crabtree Cr. (2 mi.)<br>The area is also noted for (after a heavy rain) the advanced runs on the N. Br. above Kitzmiller; Stony River below Mt. Storm, W. Va.; Georges Creek above Westernport, Md.; and the low intermediate run above Savage lake and below Barton, Md. and on New Creek above Keyser, W. Va.  Paddling in the area is often also  combined with all levels of paddling by heading W. to the Cheat, W. Va.; NW. to the Youghiogheny, Md. & Pa.; NE. to Wills Creek, Pa. or N. to the Casselman River, in Md. or Pa.  If the skies really let loose try some advanced creekin' at Greenland Gap on the North Fork of Patterson Creek by taking US 220 so. to US 50 west to 93 south to Scherr. Go east on Greenland Gap road & scout.<br><br><br>The put in for the Savage is up Savage River Road (off Md. 135, just west of the river) after crossing the river twice.  The put in for the N. Br. is to go downstream from the confluence of the two rivers and cross the river and follow WV 46 uphill - making only right turns.  Finally at three churches take the right turn down to Barnum [fee].  Check out Pap's store for sodas, snacks & stories.<br>The take out for the Savage is at the confluence with the N. Br. where there is very limited parking.  Do not aggravate the locals by breaking any parking laws or trespassing.  In addition to the limited parking here the N. Br. has additional parking upstream by going west on 135 past Savage Rd. and taking the first left (Hamill Ave.)  and then another left downhill to a county park & small sewage plant.<br><br><br>Camping:  The nicest camping is upstream of the N. Br. put in by staying straight on rt. 46 at the three churches and taking your next right in about a mile.  Campground is open May through October; reservations recommended. (304) 355-2346  Next convenient is the Big Run camp at the top of Savage lake, open year 'round -stay on Savage river rd. going around the lake. (301) 895-5453<br>Lodging:  The US 220 stretch in Keyser has a few motel places to stay.<br>Eats:  The closest restaurant is Bull's - top of the hill on 135 west, great breakfasts, good bag lunch subs & nice dinners.  Next comes the Keyser area:  Chat 'N' Chew, just north of the US 220 bridge is open late with standard fare (turn north just at the bridge by following signs to 220 south).  Jalisco in So. Keyser US 220 way south, past Wal Mart) is popular with boaters with Mexican food & beer.  The Royal on Main Street is great & about the most inexpensive place anywhere.  Castiglia's (US 220) is FANTASTIC but very crowded.  For groceries, etc. try the supermarket (Martins) just over the bridge in Keyser on the right, open 24 hours. <br>Gauges for natural flows:  Savage River should be above 2.4 (320CFS) and becomes harder just below 3.4 (880CFS) and dangerously fast above 3.8 (1200CFS). Luke/Pinto/Cumberland should be around 2.5/2.0/3.0 respectively to paddle the N. Br. and expect Luke to be around 3.6 for a fun run.  Kitzmiller should be above 4’ for the long advanced run; Wills Creek should be above 3.5 for the more popular section; Georges Creek should be above 4.5 for a paddle and higher water allows you to go way up the watershed; the stretch on the Savage below Barton probably needs between 2.1 (200CFS) and 2.6(360CFS) at Barton to run.<br>Garrett County (& vicinity), Maryland's Playground <br>Novice Runs<br>River                Section        Mileage        DifficultyFPM        Notes<br>Youghiogheny US50/Millers Run         16                A-2                4        Kitz=4.0,Oakln=2.8<br>Youghiogheny*Silver Lake-US 50*  7.5                A-1[trees]        4?

At 5' the choices broaden from the incredibly upper Canada-like upper Blackwaterin Canaan Valley and the sporting Class 2+ Glady Forkto the advanced upper Shavers Fork. If you like canoe camping and Glady Fork is up you should be in heaven. At 6' the beautiful advanced Laurel Forkis often up. Note that the Blackfork Riveris generally overrated in the guides and if you like whitewater you may find this a bit disappointing. Better to skip the whole headwaters area and paddle the Cheat Narrowsif there is not enough water up here. Restaurants aren't \"up\" much in this area either with Elkins and Parsons offering up the basics. The exceptions are the Cheat Mountain Restaurant on old 33 west of Alpina (good seafood), Alpina Restaurant (US 33), and the Blackwater Lodge in Davis. Stick with the big towns too for motels. For camping you should remember that this is also a heavenly area for backpackers, hunters and other outdoors types so plan accordingly if you have a large group or arrive late. Nice campgrounds are found in Blackwater Falls & Canaan Valley state parks and just outside Blackwater and more primitive areas are at Bear Haven near Alpina, Spruce Knob Lake and the beautiful but remote Laurel Fork Recreation Area. Try the area on the beautiful Glady Fork just downstream of the Sully Bridge too.<br><br><br>Lower Cheat Basin<br>The headwaters area of the Cheat being so large means that there is almost always water in the lower section. With Parsons above 2.2 the Cheat Narrows section below Rowlesburg (Class II-III) is up and at 2.5 the Cheat Canyon (Cl. III-IV) is manageable. It is strongly suggested that you delay your trip down the canyon if there is a good chance of the river rising as, with the huge upstream catchment area, the Cheat can rise fast and become life threatening in a few hours time. It is interesting to note that the rafting season here often ends around Memorial Day so a summer trip will often get you an uncrowded river. This area is also the \"home\" of the Big Sandywhich offers up an expert waterfalls loaded run (lower Sandy) at 5.6' at Rockville or a sporting intermediate run (upper Sandy) at 5.8'. Food & lodging are plentiful in Kingwood with the New China Restaurant (rt. 26 n.) being O.K. for dinner & Sandy's (Rt. 26., south of rt. 7) good for breakfast. Monroe's in town is well recommended. For camping try Teters (379-3626) which is a nice camp just north of Albright on 26, Pine Hill (379-4612) on Mt. Dale rd, off rt. 5 or Coopers Rock State Forest in season.<br>For 40.5 mi. Cheat River Water Trail see: www.cheatriverwatertrail.org<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The Cheat area may be a boaters paradise but if you have time you shouldn't miss sampling the Otter Creek, Laurel Fork (south of US 33) and Dolly Sods wilderness areas; the hiking trail along Glady Fork & side trips to Spruce Knob (highest point in WV), impressive Blackwater Falls, Cathedral State Park with its big trees, Coopers Rock with neat caves & impressive views of the lower Cheat Gorge.<br>Rough \"rules of thumb\" for Cheat Canyon.

But once the streams meet they flow in a beautiful valley that allow you to enjoy the scenery with nothing beyond a good Class II rapid to worry about or enjoy until the river wakes up to roar just above the confluence with the Potomac River.<br>The upper reaches include the North Fork, South Fork and main stem. The North Fork has a nice Class II section near Cootes Store (Cootes Store=3.1'+) but quickly becomes a meandering stream [with good fishing] abutting the Massanuttens & offering fine views of Great North Mountain across the valley. Look for Strasburg to be over 2.' for a nice float trip with occasional short portages of dams. The best is between Mount Jackson and Edinburg. Try it with Mt. Jackson @ 270+ CFS. The South Fork is truly among Virginias' finest resources. With Front Royal at 1.3' (better approaching 2.') you can't miss on scenery. The sections from Newport to Luray and from the low water bridge below Luray to Bentonville will provide Class I to Class II rapids in addition to scenery (including all kinds of birds overhead). Other sections will generally be Class I. With Waynesboro @ 2.7' you can easily extend the trip upstream on the South River which looks just like the Shenandoah. The Main Stem from Front Royal to WV rt. 9 is also a float trip (Millville = 1.7'). Don't expect any part of the river to be uncrowded on a summer weekend but enjoy any weekday. The Newport to Luray and Luray to Bentonville (& below to Karo Landing) are particularly popular. Headwater streams worth noting include beautiful and novicey Cedar Creek near Strasburg, which has a waterfall to paddle under, caves to paddle by and through and a civil war battlefield on its bank (Cootes Store @3.1+) and beautiful lower Hawksbill Creek with knifelike ridges at waters edge; intermediate Passage, Stony, & Mill Creeks also not far from Strasburg and Pass Run, which have short gorge sections (Cootes Store @ 3.3+); and steep & advanced Gooney Run, near Front Royal, with a section at 100' per mile drop (Glen Echo @ 2.56’) and a bit easier Naked Creek & Happy Creek.

Just below Upper Tract (On the road to Smoke Hole) the road & river turn left and a small cobble beach has the best put-in. Here there is good surfing. A short distance downstream is the BIG rapid (Cl. 3-4) with a big sheer cliff on the left. A narrow ledge on river left allows for some scouting. The rapid is a vigorous double drop with a nasty undercut on the left. Stay right or center. Set up ropes (and cameras) just downstream on the right. Scout for any strainer blocking the rapid. Portage (nasty) on the right, if necessary. Take out as far downstream (at campground) as possible for an 8 mile run. The river should be cleanly runable at the P.I. and T.O. and at places visible in between. If low water bridge (middle of run) is completely underwater, river may be too high.<br>From below Big Bend campground to Petersburg is a VERY beautiful & remote novice run of about 20 miles with limited intermediate car access [nice camper].<br>Below (north of) Moorefield is a beautiful novice 11 mile run (\"the Trough\") between Old Fields and Harmison's Landing. Lunice Creek(Class 1-2) and N. Fk. Lunice Creek(Class 1-3) can be run into Petersburg. @ 5’+ Petersburg.<br><br><br>South Fork, South Branch(Moorefield River) - The Moorefieldrun is the hardest of the three intermediate trips and the hardest to catch up. Put in below Fort Seybert and take out above Milam on the same road (rt. 7). The hardest rapid (Cl. 3-4) is near the end of the run and is a tough tweeze between sharp rocks going center left after a scout on the right. Other rapids of significance are thrown in upstream. The river should be cleanly runable at the put-in. Gauge at Milam T.O. is accurate. Moorefield gauge should read 2.65 (600 CFS); Petersburg = 4.0' Above Brandywine to Fort Seybert is a nice Cl 9+ mi. Cl 1-2 run with the Brandywine gauge @ 2.7' From Brushy Run to Brandywine is a nice 15 mi. Cl 2-3 run with Brandywine @ 2.2' or less for the lower part. Laurel Forkis a tough trib. (Cl 3-4+ with strainers) @ 7’ Petersburg?<br><br><br>North Fork, South Branch- From Circleville to Mouth of Seneca is a beautiful 16 mile Cl 2 run that is not suitable for novices because the water is fast. Judge water level from numerous access points along US 33. Above Cherry Grove requires at least 1200 CFS @ Cabins. Hopeville Canyon- From Mouth of Seneca to Dolly Camp (note small triangular cave here across river) is a nice Cl 1-2 run that is usually combined with the more difficult (Cl 2-3+)lower gorge run (3 miles). There is (occasionally) a nasty river-wide double strand of barbed wire about 5 miles into the run. The gorge has one rapid where the stream divides around a long skinny island with slightly more water going left. Go right but stay left as the rapid ends in a blind 4' drop with the best chute on the left. The river should be VERY cleanly runable under the footbridge at Seneca Rocks or it will be a long bumpy day. Below the gorge to Petersburg is a pleasant 11 mi. Cl 1-3. (4.0 min. @ Petersburg) [340 CFS @ Cabins to put in @ Cabins]<br><br><br>Seneca Creek- A FAST!! steep Cl 3 advanced run with shallow water and not too many eddies. Hard to catch up [Cabins @ 1100]. Put in about 3 miles above the mouth on US 33 or drive up the side road for a higher put-in if you can catch it. Take out at the confluence or footbridge below.<br>Gauges, etc: (703) 260-0305. The gauges for this area are Petersburg and Franklin. Petersburg should be at least 3.7 to run Hopeville Gorge, the same for Smoke Hole Gorge and higher yet (4+') for the Moorefield Gorge. Franklin and Moorefield should both be well in the upper 2' area. Gauges are updated between 10-11AM and Petersburg only is given in the evening (after 7PM). The Trough and downstream easier sections of the other rivers are up much longer than the whitewater sections. [also use Cabins @ 700 for Hopeville] (See \"backups\" on next page for other nearby watersheds).<br>Use West Virginia Whitewater and Appalachian Whitewater, Volume II and a good WVA road map. WVA Whitewater is more comprehensive. Eagles Nest outfitter on rt. 55 (north of Petersburg) is a good contact.

Try the motel/restaurant in Franklin (Thompson's)<br><br><br>River Backups: The Lost River to the eastand the Greenbrier to the southare occasionally up when the Potomac isn't. Look for Moorefield at 2.7' and Cootes Store at 4.5' for the Lost (Intermediate +). The Cacapon River below US 50 (downstream from the Lost) is a nice novice run down to 1.3' at Moorefield (Great Cacapon @ 2’). To the west(the mighty Cheat), the Dry Fork is the best intermediate run. Hendricks should be 3'- for a run here (Jenningston to Hendrix) or below US 33 on Shavers Fork (novice run). Shavers above US 33 is a good Int. + run at higher gauge levels. For remote beauty at a N/I skill level try Glady Fork with Hendricks @ 3.5+. For advanced water, Laurel Fork and Red Creek are good. Red Cr. is similar to Seneca Cr. Note that Laurel could be lethal if high. Northof this area (off rt 42.) is the North Fork of Patterson Creek (Greenland Gap) with a beautiful [difficult] 6 mile fast water run, only up after a heavy rain. Put in below Scherr at the gravel plant. If all above rivers are too dry then it is time to head for the Cheat Narrows (below Rowlesburg) which is good down to 2.2' at Parsons or hope for a Bloomington release (Md./WVa.) on the N. Br. Potomac (usually has scheduled spring and fall releases) or can run down to 350 CFS (normal daily release).<br>For a totally different novice experience try the upper Blackwater in Canaan Valley. The upper Blackwater, or better yet, the N. Br. of the Blackwater, is a beautiful but flat marsh paddle similar to that found in Canada. Davis = 2.8'. Make sure you take out well above Blackwater Falls or better yet, above Davis. Advanced boaters can try Whites Run, Roaring Creek, Horsecamp Run & Brushy Run or expert upper, upper Seneca Creek. Intermediates can try steep Big Run for 3.7 mi. above Cherry Grove with Cabins @ 6.5 <br>For a check on the Greenbrier River (mostly novice runs), call (304) 529-5127 and check water flows at Buckeye and Hilldale. Buckeye should be at least 3.5'.<br><br><br>Hiking, backpacking, X-country skiing and rafting are excellent here too. Try the Seneca Rocks visitors center for foot travel info. The North Mountain trail - off 55 near Smoke Hole Caverns is exceptionally rugged and beautiful. Spruce Knob - highest point in WV - is just south off 28 and worth a visit too.<br>Garrett County (& vicinity), Maryland's Playground<br>Novice Runs<br>RiverSectionMileageDifficultyFPMNotes<br>Youghiogheny US50/Millers Run 16 A-2 4 Kitz=4.0,Oakln=2.8<br>Youghiogheny*Silver Lake-US 50* 7.5 A-1[trees] 4?

II w/long shuttle & flatwater @ end","Washington DC metro area paddling":"Washington D.C. metro area paddling9/00<br><br><br>Washington is choicely situated at the confluence of the Anacostia and Potomac rivers at the fall line. The fall line rapids north and south of town are varied but typically of the Cl III variety. Below the fall line is reliable paddling on the Potomac (pretty between Chain Bridge & Georgetown), Anacostia (now mostly ugly but being improved) and Patuxent (and tributaries) Rivers. Other flat & dependable areas include the Occoquanreservoir and numerous county parks with lakes in Md. & Va., theC&O Canaland AccotinkandPohickbays, accessible from Pohick Bay Park and pretty Nanjemoy Creekin Charles Co with a few bald eagles and similar Kanes Creekon Mason Neck, Va.<br>Try the many lakes in the area too, like the upper marshes of Lake Accotink.<br>But Washington is also known for reliable whitewater as the Potomacis rarely too low to paddle. Great Fallsarea has numerous Cl V+ routes to explore and Little Fallshas sporting routes up to a solid Cl III+. In between are areas for flat cruising & Cl II and III playing and surfing. Most surfing is in Mather Gorge or just above Little Falls. The area well upstream around Violettes Lockhas a delightful circuit using the remains of the Potomack canal on the Virginia side of the river (with easy rapids) and the C&O canal on the Md. side. In between, on the main channels, are Cl II rapids also. Camping spots can be found on islands well upstream of D.C. but is generally prohibited in the metro area. Because of the confluence of great boating, birding, hiking and biking opportunities along the Potomac, you will find parking at a premium on weekends. Prime access points are: Lock 6 (for Little Falls), and Carderock picnic area (both off the Clara Barton Parkway), Old Anglers parking off McArthur Blvd. (for lower Mather Gorge), Great Falls Park (Va. or Md.) for the upper gorge and Violettes Lock Rd. off River Road. Novices should also consider the long Monocacy River(Frederick gauge @ 2'-), Seneca Creek(Dawsonville @ 2.2') which usually has some strainers, Middle Patuxent River(Dawsonville ~@ 2.7), Bennett Creek(Frederick~@ 4.0), Patuxent Riverbelow Bowie (Dawsonville @~2.2) with restricted access, South Branch Patapsco(Dawsonville @~2.6), [all in Md.], Goose Creek(Leesburg @ 2.1) above rt. 7, Difficult Run(Dawsonville @~2.4) between rts. 7 and 193 only [Cl. 2-5/7 below rt. 193], historic Bull Run (Remington~@ 4.5) and its tributary Popes Head Creek [all in Va.] and Catoctin Creeksin Md. & Va. (Leesburg @~2.4). Intermediate boaters can enjoy the fall lines of Rock Creekin D.C. (Dawsonville~@3') and Cub Runjust below US 29 (Leesburg~@2.8), Pohick Creek(Remington~@6'), So. Run, Pohick(Remington~@7') and Broad Runabove I-66 (Remington~@7') in Va. and Little Patuxent Riverabove Savage (Dawsonville~@2.6) and Patapsco Riverabove Ellicott City (Dawsonville~@2.6) in Md.; all up onlywithin 24 hrs. after a moderately heavy rain. The nearest advanced boating not otherwise mentioned above is Gooney Creeknear Front Royal, Va. (Cootes Store~@7'). Little gems that stay up less than 12 hrs. after a heavy rain are: N.W. Branch,Sligo Creek,Cabin John Creek,Pimmit Run,Neabsco Run,Quantico Creek, and Aquia Creek. Various sections of water near Baltimore (Gunpowder), Fredericksburg (Rappahannock), Richmond (James) and Harpers Ferry are up most of the year and described elsewhere. Other novice areas further out that are usually always up are Antietam Creek(Sharpsburg @ 2.5), Rappahannockfrom above US 29 to I-95 (Remington @ 3.3), the South Fork, Shenandoahfrom well above Luray to Front Royal (and downstream to Harpers Ferry) (Front Royal @ 1.2) and Mattaponiand Pamunkeyrivers below I-95.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Local parks with boatable water contacts:<br>Rock Creek (202) 426-6829 - MNCPPC (most PG & Mont Co. parks)(301) 454-1411<br>No. Va.
