		<h1>Rivers.run Voice Assistant</h1>

        <h2>Get river levels and more using your voice!</h2>

        <h3>For Google Assistant:</h3>
        <p>Take a look at the <a href="https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000a35e5ba055" target="_blank">rivers.run action</a> for Google Assistant. It is able to provide water levels, relative flows, and temperatures</p>

        <h3>For Amazon Alexa:</h3>
        <p>A skill for Amazon Alexa is still under development</p>

        <h3>For Microsoft Cortona:</h3>
        <p>Microsoft requires a billable Azure account to create an action, something that is a bit of a hassle to set up.</p>

        <h3>For iOS Siri:</h3>
        <p>Interfacing with Siri requires a native app. Since Apple wants quite a bit of money every year to put an app in the app store, there are currently no plans to add support for iOS Siri.</p>
        <p>You can however, install <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-assistant/id1220976145" target="_blank">Google Assistant for iOS</a>, and use our Google Assistant action.</p>

        <h3>For MacOS Siri:</h3>
        <p>I am looking into the possibility of building an application for Siri on MacOS.</p>
