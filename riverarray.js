Potomac\"Needles\"through Harper's Ferry cuts through the nearby mountains.  The Harper's Ferry area is home to the Potomac \"Needles\" (novice skills with full floatation suggested, Class I to III) as well as many miles of flat floating waters both upstream on the Shenadoah and Potomac and downstream on the Potomac.  This section of river is very reliable with the Potomac section up except in severe drought (Shepardstown = 1.4 or Point of Rocks at .5).  Consider any of these gauges above 4' with caution and over 5' as requiring big river water skills.  <br>Ins and Outs: The Staircase section and the Needles section are used by countless thousands of paddlers each season and a certain history should be known about the area.  There are significant vandalism, property owner and access problems that need to be considered.  The three take-outs for either river is at 1)Potoma wayside in Virginia - on US340, just over the bridge from Maryland.  There is parking for 3-4 cars - PERIOD!!  If you park in the no parking zone (virtually the entire area) you will be ticketed & towed.  What “may” work is to park in the large lot just past the gas station and walk to your car.  This is subject to negotiation when the lot is in use for fireworks, food, etc.  2)The second takeout is at Weverton in Maryland.  This is found by driving to the yellow light just in Maryland, turning downstream (pass Cindy-D restaurant) and driving to the end where there is shoulder parking.  Do not block the gate where you will be towed.  Walk past the gate and down to the river to identify the takeout (upstream) from the river.  3)The last takeout suggested is at the convenient boat ramp in Brunswick (under the rt. 17 bridge).  This involves 3 miles of flat water paddling and a bit of scouting to get to by car - take 340 north to first Brunswick/Knoxville exit and take first right (rt. 478), still following the railroad.  Go under overhead bridge and take a right onto the only road going across the tracks and then turn right to boat ramp. Do not block ramp, turning area or parking areas from use by large trailered vehicles.  For both rivers there is limited put-in access also.  Although there has been some vandalism at the suggested take-outs, most problems occur at the put-ins.  If you are paddling the Potomac you most likely will want to put-in at the Shinham boat ramp; drive US 340 into Maryland and take the first right (at the flashing light) and then the first right again (pass youth hostel and Sandy Hook) and continue on same road away from river until about the third left - (road going downhill) to ramp.  Again, do not block others with large trailers from using the ramp or parking areas.  The recommended second put-in is on the WV side of the river which has a private outfitter that will allow access in season for a price [per trip or per season].<br>Tips: Take-outs fill up early on a hot summer day so arrive early.  Both runs are somewhat short but can involve a full days activity if you play a lot or lengthen the trip.  River & Trails Outfitters (flashing light, 340 just in Maryland) has all your basic river supplies/shuttle and the Sheetz gas station in Brunswick (US 340 to rt. 17) has best gas prices and yummy subs.<br><br>Monacacy: Low Intermediate 2-2+; Hancock 3.0"},{"usgs":"03190000","tags":"wv","name":"Meadow River","section":"above Rainelle","skill":"N","rating":"2","writeup":"Meadow River: A high water only tributary of the Gauley River with lots of undercuts.<br>above Rainelle: Many miles of Cl. 1+ water with possible wood.

Although there has been some vandalism at the suggested take-outs, most problems occur at the put-ins.  The Shenandoah has two recommended put-ins.  The \"guidebook\" put in is at the power company picnic area well above Millville (take US 340 west into WV and turn left at the flea market (Millville rd.); go through \"town\" and follow the river upstream to just before the road veers to the right away from the river.  This involves talking to the local picnicers about whether it is OK to park there.  They will usually watch your car only as long as they are there.  If there aren't many people here, as is the case along the river downstream or in cold weather, your car may be picked clean while you are gone.  In season (Aprilish to Octoberish), there is an outfitter park nearer Millville where an individual will watch cars for $5. per car.  This is well worth it.  Parking nearby may not get your car back in one piece.  Do NOT stop at Harper's Ferry (river left) on your trip or you may be arrested by park police!  <br>Tips: Take-outs fill up early on a hot summer day so arrive early.
